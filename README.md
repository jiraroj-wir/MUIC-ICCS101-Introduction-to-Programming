# MUIC-ICCS101: Introduction to Programming  
**Academic Year 2024–25, Trimester 3**

This repository contains coursework for **ICCS101 - Introduction to Programming** at **Mahidol University International College (MUIC)**. The course introduces Python programming, problem-solving strategies, and the mindset of computational thinking. This repo includes my personal work throughout the trimester — mostly assignments, but I may also share quizzes, exams, or in-class activities when appropriate.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm currently a student in this course using **LunarVim (Neovim distro)** on macOS (M1, ARM64) with Zsh. I'm comfortable with macOS and Linux but probably can't help much with Windows or IDE-specific issues. If you need help or want to discuss concepts, feel free to email me — I'm not a pro at Python or CS yet, but always happy to help where I can.
