# Assignment 3 - Professor Feedback ðŸ’¬

These are the professorâ€™s feedback on my solutions.  
I'm too lazy to fix them ðŸ˜´ â€” the assignment was already marked after the due date, and there's really no benefit to rewriting any of these.

That said, **all the solutions passed the grader âœ…**, but the prof ran them through **larger test cases** ðŸ§ª and evaluated things like edge handling and forbidden logic ðŸš«.

## Feedback Summary ðŸ“„

### `aggregate.py` (1 / 10)

```text
Read the rule carefully

For this task, use only Boolean/math expressions and conditional statements (if-statements). Do not use built-in function for sorting or finding min, max, etc.
```

### `digit.py` (10 / 10)

```text
You can simply b ** k.
```

### `righttri.py` (4 / 10)

```text
If bkkHour = 11, then ur nyc hour =24 and will go to 12 pm but it should be 12 am. Also logic error, if nychhour=0 24 will be added so nychour==0 will never be reached.
```
